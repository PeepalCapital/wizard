**Foreword by Alan Perlis**
- Every computer program is a model, hatched in the mind, of a real or mental process. These processes, arising from human experience and thought, are huge in number, intricate in detail, and at any time only partially understood.
- If art interprets our dreams, the computer executes them in the guise of programs!
- For all its power, the computer is a harsh taskmaster.
- Unlike programs, computers must obey the laws of physics.
- Hardware always operates at a level more primitive than that at which we care to program.
- The computers are never large enough or fast enough.
- A programmer should acquire good algorithms and idioms.
- Even though some programs resist precise specifications, it is the responsibility of the programmer to estimate, and always to attempt to improve, their performance.
- Lisp is a survivor.
- Lisp changes.
- Pascal is for building pyramids — imposing, breathtaking, static structures built by armies pushing heavy blocks into place.
- Lisp is for building organisms — imposing, breathtaking, dynamic structures built by squads fitting fluctuating myriads of simpler organisms into place.
- It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than to have 10 functions operate on 10 data structures. As a result the pyramid must stand unchanged for a millennium; the organism must evolve or perish.

**Preface to 1st ed.**
- Computer programs are good, they say, for particular purposes, but they aren’t flexible. Neither is a violin, or a typewriter, until you learn how to use it.
- “Computer science” is not a science and that its significance has little to do with computers.
- The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think.
- Procedural epistemology — the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects.
- Mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of “what is.” Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of “how to.”

**Preface to 2nd ed.**
- In literal realization of an ancient Talmudic pun, our students have become our builders.

**Acknowledgments**
- A student’s ability to write and modify programs provides a powerful medium in which exploring becomes a natural activity.

**Building Abstractions with Procedures**
- The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas, are chiefly these three: 1. Combining several simple ideas into one compound one, and thus all complex ideas are made. 2. The second is bringing two ideas, whether simple or complex, together, and setting them by one another so as to take a view of them at once, without uniting them into one, by which it gets all its ideas of relations. 3. The third is separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real existence: this is called abstraction, and thus all its general ideas are made.
- Computational processes are abstract beings that inhabit computers.
- Processes manipulate other abstract things called data.
- The evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules called a program.
- People create programs to direct processes.
- We conjure the spirits of the computer with our spells.
- A computational process is indeed much like a sorcerer’s idea of a spirit. It cannot be seen or touched. It is not composed of matter at all. However, it is very real. It can perform intellectual work. It can answer questions.
- The programs we use to conjure processes are like a sorcerer’s spells.
- Like the sorcerer’s apprentice, novice programmers must learn to understand and to anticipate the consequences of their conjuring.
- Visualize the behavior of the systems in advance.
- Well designed computational systems, like well designed automobiles or nuclear reactors, are designed in a modular manner.
- Language provides for combining simple ideas to form more complex ideas.
