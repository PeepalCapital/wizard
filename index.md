**Foreword by Alan Perlis**
- Every computer program is a model, hatched in the mind, of a real or mental process. These processes, arising from human experience and thought, are huge in number, intricate in detail, and at any time only partially understood.
- If art interprets our dreams, the computer executes them in the guise of programs!
- For all its power, the computer is a harsh taskmaster.
- Unlike programs, computers must obey the laws of physics.
- Hardware always operates at a level more primitive than that at which we care to program.
- The computers are never large enough or fast enough.
- A programmer should acquire good algorithms and idioms.
- Even though some programs resist precise specifications, it is the responsibility of the programmer to estimate, and always to attempt to improve, their performance.
- Lisp is a survivor.
- Lisp changes.
- Pascal is for building pyramids — imposing, breathtaking, static structures built by armies pushing heavy blocks into place.
- Lisp is for building organisms — imposing, breathtaking, dynamic structures built by squads fitting fluctuating myriads of simpler organisms into place.
- It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than to have 10 functions operate on 10 data structures. As a result the pyramid must stand unchanged for a millennium; the organism must evolve or perish.

**Preface to 1st ed.**
- Computer programs are good, they say, for particular purposes, but they aren’t flexible. Neither is a violin, or a typewriter, until you learn how to use it.
- “Computer science” is not a science and that its significance has little to do with computers.
- The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think.
- Procedural epistemology — the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects.
- Mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of “what is.” Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of “how to.”

**Preface to 2nd ed.**
- In literal realization of an ancient Talmudic pun, our students have become our builders.

**Acknowledgments**
- A student’s ability to write and modify programs provides a powerful medium in which exploring becomes a natural activity.
